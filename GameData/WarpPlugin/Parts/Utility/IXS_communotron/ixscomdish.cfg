	description = Although the Communotron 99-99 boasts an impressive amount of bandwidth available, it is limited to sending signals at the speed of light. However, it's still the best option, given that nothing came of WarpTech Industries' ambitious plan to replace all radio communication systems with small warp-capable ships piloted by carrier pigeons.
