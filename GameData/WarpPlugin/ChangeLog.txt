KSPI 1.7.0

- Added Magneto Inertial Fusion Rocket Engine (Artist nli2work) 
- Added Tokamak Engine, which Conbines Fusuin Reactor with integrated Magnetic Noozle (Credids for SilverSilver for retexture)
- Added XI Fusion Reactor which combines a Magnetic Confinement Reactor with Direct Energy Converter
- Added Half Size Wrap Radiator (Artist PorcJet)
- Added 4 additional techlevel to Interstellar Radiators which are unlock by CTT heat management tech nodes
- Improve Compatibilty with Navigation tools like MechJeb and Better Burn prediction (Thanks to RxTen1)
- Increased Isp of open cycle Gas Core Reactor 
- Thermal Nozzle with Isp higher than 3000s will function as a magnetic nozzle and therefore will not be effecive withing admospheres
- Science Lab now requires MegaWatt power to convert science data into reseach data
- Mass Energy Geenrator depends on Power output reactor and Technology 
- Direct Energy Converter now requires High Tech Electric Systems to be unlocked
- Increased Volume Fusion Reactor, Incresed Mass and Reduced Initial Power Output
- Fusion Reactors now has up to 5 techlevels
- Merged Dumbo and Solid Core Reactor (NERVA) which now has 5 tech levels
- Reduced Initial Power Output Pebble Bed Reactor but added 2 additional tech levels
- Fusion Mode proton-Boron11 now required Exotic Fusion Tech
- Darkened Wrapped Radiators
